Welcome to the Python Memory Game!
In Memory, several cards are displayed face down on a
board. Each card has a matching pair. The goal of a
single player game is to match pairs until all cards on
the board are matched. Players will flip up two cards at
a time. If the cards do not match, they will flip back
over. Be sure to remember their positions! If the cards
do match, then points are added to the score, the cards
will disappear, and the score multiplier is increased.
The score multiplier helps add bonus points onto your
score and will increase for every pair you match in a
row. However, if you lose your matching streak, the
multiplier will reset. Try to get the highest score
possible! After a single player game, you can save your
score, as well as view other people’s scores.
In multiplayer, the rules are the same as a single
player game, but players will take turns matching two
cards at a time. The player with the highest score at
the end wins the round.
Good Luck!
